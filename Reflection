"Overall, we learnt how to effectively use Git and the intricacies that come with it. We learnt about system prompts, instructions on how
the program should be run, reference files, which are similar to system prompts in that they contain instructions on how the program 
should run, and the purpose of GitHub. Despite the description, System Prompts and Reference Files are not lines of code, per se, since 
their instructions can be as simple as “store internally in JSON format”, which is not traditional code. GitHub, meanwhile, is a platform 
used to collaborate on Git projects and to share them across the web, as well as a repository for projects saved to a cloud or common 
server (not localized to the user’s desktop)."
